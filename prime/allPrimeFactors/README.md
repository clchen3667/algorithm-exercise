Given an integer N, for which 2 <= N <= 10^12, find its prime factors. The result must be a list of sorted prime numbers where each number is listed as many times as it is present in the prime decomposition of N.

Examples:
	1.For N=20 the prime decomposition is 20 = 2 * 2 * 5, so you must return 2, 2, 5;
	2.For N=64 the prime decomposition is 64 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2, result must be 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2.
